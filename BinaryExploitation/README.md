## Basic Tools
- `checksec`: Analyze security features of binaries.
- `gdb`: Debug and analyze binary execution.
- `pwndbg`: GDB extension for exploitation.
- `gef`: Another GDB extension for binary analysis.
- `peda`: Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB.
- `radare2`: Open-source reverse engineering framework.
- `objdump`: Disassemble and inspect object files.
- `readelf`: Retrieve metadata from ELF files.
- `patchelf`: Modify ELF binaries.
- `ltrace` and `strace`: Trace library and system calls.

## Docker
- `theflash2k/pwn-dev`

## Terminologies
- Stack Overflow: Overwriting return addresses in stack memory.
- Heap Overflow: Exploiting memory mismanagement in heap.
- Format String Vulnerability: Exploiting uncontrolled format string inputs.
- ROP (Return Oriented Programming): Chaining gadgets to execute arbitrary instructions.
- JOP (Jump Oriented Programming): Similar to ROP but using jump instructions.
- GOT Overwrite: Modifying function pointers in the Global Offset Table to redirect execution.
- PLT Hijacking: Exploiting the Procedure Linkage Table to control execution flow.
- Return to Libc: Calling existing library functions to execute arbitrary code.
- Sandbox Evasion: Bypassing restricted execution environments.

## Exploitation Techniques
- Stack-based Buffer Overflow: Overwriting return addresses to hijack execution.
- Heap-based Exploitation: Manipulating dynamic memory allocation for control.
- Integer Overflow: Exploiting arithmetic errors to bypass security checks.
- Format String Exploits: Leaking memory or modifying execution flow via uncontrolled format strings.
- Return to Libc: Calling existing library functions to execute arbitrary code.
- ROP (Return Oriented Programming): Chaining gadgets to execute arbitrary instructions.
- JOP (Jump Oriented Programming): Similar to ROP but using jump instructions.
- GOT Overwrite: Modifying function pointers in the Global Offset Table to redirect execution.
- PLT Hijacking: Exploiting the Procedure Linkage Table to control execution flow.
- Code Injection: Injecting shellcode into a process and executing it.
- Heap Spraying: Filling heap memory with attacker-controlled data to influence exploitation.
- Use-After-Free (UAF): Exploiting dangling pointers after memory deallocation.
